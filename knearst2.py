# Assuming df is your dataframe with spatial features and target variable

# Step 1: Feature Extraction
# Extract relevant features from the dataframe (e.g., coordinates)
# Example: X = df[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']].values
X = df[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']].values

# Extract the target variable
y = df['target'].values

# Step 2: Delaunay Triangulation
# Perform Delaunay triangulation on the spatial features
tri = Delaunay(X)

# Get the indices of the triangles
triangle_indices = tri.simplices

# Compute additional features based on the triangulation (e.g., triangle areas)
triangle_areas = np.array([tri.area for tri in tri.triangles])

# Concatenate the additional features with the original features
X = np.hstack((X, triangle_areas.reshape(-1, 1)))

# Step 3: Machine Learning Model
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest classifier
rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Random Forest Accuracy:", accuracy)
